    <h2>Hi, I’m Damiano, the Mastermind behind this Recipe Book of up to 4 recipes!</h2>
    <p>
        Born with a whisk in one hand and a spatula in the other, I’ve been cooking up chaos in the kitchen since I could reach and burn myself on the stove.
        I used to hard-boil eggs, but now I make them soft because I'm a Michelin-star chef.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not cooking, I’m probably eating. Now, I hope you love all my detailed recipes, you will only ever need these 4 to open your own poorly hygiene-rated cafe.
